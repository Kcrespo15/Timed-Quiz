# Timed-Quiz
## Description

The purpose of this project was to apply JavaScript and web API fundamentals to build a coding quiz application. During the development process, I learned how to apply document object methods and properties, utlilize event handlers, alter attributes of HTML elements using JavaScript, and write more complex JavaScript functions than I was previously able to. Furthermore, this application serves as a practice tool for technical assessments.

## Usage

Users will be taken through 7 multiple-choice questions as time permits.
At the end of the quiz, the user will be prompted to enter their initials to save their score. To view the list of high scores, click on the "View High Scores" button in the top left corner.
